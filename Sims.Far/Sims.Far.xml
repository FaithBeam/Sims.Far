            The FAR format (.far files) are used to bundle (archive) multiple files together. All numeric values in the header and manifest are stored in little-endian order(least significant byte first).

            <summary>
            The manifest offset is the byte offset from the beginning of the file to the manifest.
            The contents of the archived files are simply concatenated together without any other structure or padding.Caveat: all of the files observed have been a multiple of four in length, so it's possible that the files may be padded to a two-byte or four-byte boundary and the case has simply never been encountered.

            The manifest contains a count of the number of archived files, followed by an entry for each file. In all of the examples examined the order of the entries matches the order of the archived files, but whether this is a firm requirement or not is unknown.

            The file length is stored twice. Perhaps this is because some variant of FAR files supports compressed data and the fields would hold the compressed and uncompressed sizes, but this is pure speculation. The safest thing to do is to leave the fields identical.
